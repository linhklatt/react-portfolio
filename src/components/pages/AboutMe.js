      <p>
        Hi, I'm Linh Klatt. After spending five years as a stay-at-home mom, I
        made the decision to return to school and pursue my passion for software
        engineering. I've always had a fascination with computers and
        technology, enjoying the process of troubleshooting, hands-on work,
        problem-solving, and finding solutions. Currently, I'm attending a
        Coding Bootcamp at UCSD while also working towards completing my AA
        degree. My ultimate goal is to transfer to either UCSD or USUSM.
        Currently, I'm working as a project team leader at a global company that
        specializes in innovative distribution, fulfillment, and reverse
        logistics services for the wireless communications industry.
